<h1>Subscribing to RSS feed for a single phpbb forum</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=25">forum</a> for usage questions about nHibernate is a sub forum on the <a href="http://forum.hibernate.org/">hibernate forum site</a>. When you are in the nHibernate sub forum a nice and shiny RSS button is shown but the feed that it links to contains all items from all sub forums on the site which is not what i expected. I have lived with this for a while but today I got tired of it and did a little investigation. The forum runs on <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/">phpBB</a> and a quick look around suggested that appending the forum identifier in the URL showed me only posts for this forum. I wonder why this is not part of the UI as its a rather nice feature to limit the amount of irrelevant information. </p>  <p>So in short to subscribe to only the nHibernate forum use this URL: <a title="http://forum.hibernate.org/rss.php?f=25" href="http://forum.hibernate.org/rss.php?f=25">http://forum.hibernate.org/rss.php?f=25</a></p>
