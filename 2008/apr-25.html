<h1>Small challenge: call method on null</h1>
<p>Inspired by some talk I &quot;overheard&quot; on twitter I thought it would be interesting to post a small challenge. Is it possible to implement the missing parts of the following code so it compiles and runs without exceptions, if yes how would you do it? You are not allowed to modify the body of the Main method but the rest is up to you.</p>  <pre class="code-csharp" name="code">static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Foo f = null;
    f.Bar();
}</pre>

<p>And yes its a pretty useless exercise :-)</p>
